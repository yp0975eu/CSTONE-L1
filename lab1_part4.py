# Write a program that fetches data from a web server using an open API.
#  Ask me for the server you should use and the specific data you should fetch.

# You'll need to do some research into how to carry out these tasks in Python. (Hint: the requests library)

# Your Python program will make a request to the website, and get data as JSON.
#  You'll need to process this to extract the data you need.

# You should handle errors, such as access denied, no network connection, invalid response....

# Extra challenge: your program should cache data locally to avoid excessive requests.
#  If the user has made a request recently, your program should fetch the data from the cache instead of the website.
